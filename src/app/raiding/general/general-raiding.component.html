            <h3><u>Schedules</u></h3>
            <p>
                These times are fairly established. We encourage all raiders to be ready to go 15 minutes before
                raid time starts. Raid time should be just clearing bosses, not waiting for people to log on.

        <ng-template ngbNavContent>
            <h3><u>General Expectations</u></h3>
            <p>
                These expectations hold true for both the Mythic and Heroic teams. Be sure to read these and be sure
                that you are willing to meet these expectations each and every night. Raid night is first and
                foremost for boss killing.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Be online on time and able to spend 3 hours uninterrupted. The raid team will not wait for you;
                    it starts at the scheduled time and backups will take your spot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let the Raid Leader know if you cannot make the raid. Consistently leaving early or random AFKs
                    will reduce the chance you'll be asked to return. No call/no shows will not be invited later in
                    the night.
                </li>
                <li>Attendance is crucial to progressing in a raid tier.</li>
                <li>Raiders will review Uranium's PowerPoints prior to the first encounter with a boss.</li>
                <li>
                    Don’t be impaired while we are progressing. Once a raid is on-farm, or while we are doing
                    non-progression raiding, we don't care, so long as it doesn't negatively affect the social
                    aspect of the group. "On-farm" means we can clear a raid in one night.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Raid Assistants will be picked by the Raid Leader to help them. They can promote as many as they
                    need. Raid Assistants are priority shot callers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Raid discipline is critical. By this we mean: moving through trash efficiently, maintaining
                    essential communications during boss pulls, and minimizing downtime between pulls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All raiders will have WeakAuras, Exorsus Raid Tools, and
                    BigWigs (or DBM).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To become a full-time raider, meet all of the noted expectations listed above, the expectations for
                your specific team, and show up (on time) for two consecutive weeks while participating in a raid
                team.
            </p>
            <p><strong>
                You can lose raider rank by "no call, no showing" for two consecutive weeks.

        <ng-template ngbNavContent>
            <h3><u>Loot / BoEs</u></h3>
            <p>
                We want to be very clear and explicit when it comes to loot drops as it can be a point of
                contention. Our loot rules are broken up into two types: personal and BoEs
            </p>
            <h4>Personal Loot</h4>
            <p>
                All personal loot belongs to the raider who looted it. They are under no obligation to trade it to
                any member of the raid. Traded gear will follow these rules when it is being rolled on:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Main Spec (main character)</li>
                <li>Main Spec (side-grade)</li>
                <li>Off Spec</li>
                <li>Alts</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Our gearing philosophy places a higher importance on new and current member's main character above
                alts.
            </p>
            <h4>BoEs</h4>
            <p>
                BoE’s that drop during raid night will be given to the Raid Leader and sold on the AH for guild bank
                revenue. However, any guild member may buy the item BoE from the guild bank at half price. You will
                be supplied with <u>ALL</u> flasks, food, potions, vantus runes, and repairs needed for raiding and
                M+. Raiders may pull consumables out of the bank everyday as needed. This rule applies to any
                Uranium raider in any Uranium raid.
            </p>
