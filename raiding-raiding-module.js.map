More knowledge leads to\n                    more DPS which leads to better parses. That same though process extends to fights. Read our slides\n                    and strats and intimately familiarize yourself with them.\n                </dd>\n                <hr class=\"my-1\"/>\n                <dt class=\"col-lg-3\">Parses</dt>\n                <dd class=\"col-lg-9\">\n                    Parse are the best metric to understand your personal performance compared to the WoW community\n                    around the world. Because of this, it is also our best metric to determine that performance. We\n                    require parses around an 80% for heroic fights once they are on farm. That same parse level must be\n                    maintained for re-clear bosses through mythic raids as well.\n                </dd>\n                <hr class=\"my-1\"/>\n                <dt class=\"col-lg-3\">General Awareness</dt>\n                <dd class=\"col-lg-9\">\n                    While we assure that important mechanics will be called out in a fight, we do expect that you are\n                    able to keep track of personal mechanics as well as perform to the best of your abilities.

We're not personally attacking anyone when we do this; if we didn't\n                    think you were a good player, you wouldn't be on the team.

It means cracking hard at attempts with a\n                    couple scheduled breaks and not much else in between.

Once a raid is on-farm, or while we are doing\n                    non-progression raiding, we don't care, so long as it doesn't negatively affect the social\n                    aspect of the group. \"On-farm\" means we can clear a raid in one night.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    Raid Assistants will be picked by the Raid Leader to help them.

They are under no obligation to trade it to\n                any member of the raid.

However, any guild member may buy the item BoE from the guild bank at half price. You will\n                be supplied with <u>ALL</u> flasks, food, potions, vantus runes, and repairs needed for raiding and\n                M+. Raiders may pull consumables out of the bank everyday as needed.
